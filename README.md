# MC-Extended

MC-Extended is a mod intended to take Vanilla Minecraft and seamlessly improve on it. So, I‚Äôve added a little of everything (well, I haven‚Äôt added biomes yet, or dimensions). I‚Äôve added a bunch of ores, armor, weapons, four mobs (one of them is a new golem), foods, and even more. I‚Äôm trying not to change that wonderful feeling of vanilla, but just expand it a little.

## What's in the Box?

- **New Gear Tiers** - Ever wanted to, I dunno, make some armor out of that cool copper? How about not stopping at Netherite? Wouldn‚Äôt that be cool? Well, I‚Äôm here to tell you that you can. I‚Äôve added Copper, Tin, Ruby, Corundum gear tiers, and more.
- **New Villager Professions** ‚Äì Meet the Gem Dealer, Miner, and Botanist. These fellows know about their professions and sell things just like you might expect, and want‚Ä¶ Just trust me when I say you don‚Äôt want furnaces to have blocks of air above them.
- **More Mobs** ‚Äì The Ender Cube drops valuable (well, to me and other casual players anyway)¬†Ender Cream, and the Lost predates the Bogged. (Thanks, Minecraft, for stealing my idea of a swamp skeleton.) The Silver Golem is quick and painful, and trout tastes good!
- **Better Food** ‚Äì Tomatoes, Cheese, Bacon, and Mushrooms! Saag, Spinach, and more! I‚Äôve upgraded the "culinary experience‚Äù for sure.
- **Crafting Tweaks** ‚Äì The Plant Specimen and a few random tweaks are pretty useful.

## FAQ (or "Stuff People Keep Asking")

- **Can I put this in my modpack?**

  - Yep! Just toss in a credit and maybe a link back here. Mods are for modpacks‚Ä¶ and I ain‚Äôt no moron.

- **Will you port this to older Minecraft versions?**

  - Nope. This mod is forward-only, so look at the newest version and expect improvements in that one.

- **Forge version when?**

  - Never. This is a Fabric-only mod. Fabric just works better for this project. (Okay, maybe I‚Äôll try if folks want it that bad.)
